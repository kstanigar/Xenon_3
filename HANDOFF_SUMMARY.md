## Session: June 23, 2026 — Status: ⏳ PENDING

**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.6
**Branch:** dev

### What Was Accomplished

**App Check + Firestore Hardening:**
- ✅ Task 1: Firestore security rules deployed (Firebase Console, user action) — `request.app.token.valid == true` on create + update; bot writes blocked at rules level
- ⏳ Task 2: App Check enforcement — NOT ready. Do not enforce until verified ~90% + outdated ~0%. Re-check ~July 6–7.
- ✅ Task 3: Leaderboard error message updated — game.html:1457 + game_mobile.html:1397 (PR #150, merged June 23)

**Branch Cleanup — ✅ Complete (June 23):**
- Deleted 128 stale remote branches
- Only `origin/dev` and `origin/main` remain
- `dev` and `main` branch-protected — deletion blocked as expected (correct behavior)

**Copyright Update — ✅ Complete (PR pending, June 23):**
- "Raginats" → "Standing Tiger" linking to `/contact.html` in all end-game screens
- game.html: 4 locations — lines 6022, 6350, 7112, 7437 (victory + 3 game over variants)
- game_mobile.html: 4 locations — lines 6644, 6995, 7783, 7984 (victory + 3 game over variants)
- Ko-fi URLs (`ko-fi.com/raginats`) left unchanged — functional Ko-fi account handle

### Next Steps
- [ ] Commit + PR copyright changes (branch: `fix/copyright-standing-tiger`)
- [ ] Merge dev → main (deploys all work since PR #141 to production)
- [ ] GA4 final_score chart — check GA4 Explore for data, build Final Score × New Tier chart (see docs/GA4_FINAL_SCORE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- [ ] App Check Task 2 — re-check metrics ~July 6–7, enforce when verified ~90% + outdated ~0%
- [ ] Pink Infinite Level — #1 feature priority after dev → main merge

## Session: June 22, 2026 — Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.6
**Branch:** dev

### What Was Accomplished

**App Check metrics check (June 22, 2026):**
- 503 total requests over last 7 days (Jun 10–18 window shown)
- ✅ Verified: 57% (287 requests)
- ⚠️ Unverified outdated clients: 12% (58 requests) — users on old cached HTML without App Check
- ✅ Unverified unknown origin: 0%
- ❌ Unverified invalid: 31% (158 requests) — unknown source (bots or other), under investigation

**Decision:** Do NOT enforce yet. Firebase guidance is ~90%+ verified ("almost all requests") — prior 85% target was incorrect. Key findings from Firebase docs (haiku agent, June 22):
- Outdated clients will NOT self-resolve on web — users must hard-refresh or clear cache
- Invalid requests are not definitively bots — may include test environments, cached old page loads
- Enforcement is a full block (`permission-denied` on all Firestore calls, no graceful degradation)

**Fix deployed — June 22, PR #149:**
- Set `Cache-Control: no-cache` on all HTML files in S3 sync workflow
- Set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on all non-HTML assets
- Effect: browsers will always fetch fresh HTML → outdated clients should drop toward 0% over 1–2 weeks
- Even if outdated resolves fully, verified only reaches ~69% — 31% invalid is the real blocker
**Invalid requests investigation — reCAPTCHA Console checked June 22:**
- reCAPTCHA only saw **3 requests** over the same 7-day window where Firebase App Check logged 503
- All 3 scored **0.9–1.0** (perfect legitimate human scores) — 0% suspicious
- Score threshold is NOT the problem — real players score fine
- **Root cause confirmed: 31% invalid = direct API bots** — hitting Firestore without loading the frontend game at all, so no reCAPTCHA token is ever generated
- No config fix needed — reCAPTCHA is working correctly for real users

**Revised enforcement strategy:**
- Real players are fine (0.9–1.0 scores) — enforcement won't hurt them
- Bots are the 31% invalid — enforcement is exactly what kills them
- Blocker is not the bots themselves, but getting verified % to ~90% first
- Path to enforcement: wait for cache-control fix (PR #149) to clear outdated clients (~69% verified) + organic verified growth before enforcing
- Once verified reaches ~90%, enforce — bots get blocked, real players unaffected

Re-check metrics ~July 6–7.

**GA4 final_score chart:** Not yet checked this session — still pending. Check GA4 Explore for `final_score` data and build Final Score × New Tier chart.

**Dev → Main merge:** Status unconfirmed — user was smoke testing `dev.nonx.standingtiger.com` after June 15 session. Confirm before starting Pink Infinite Level work.

---

## Next Session Plan — App Check Enforcement + Firestore Hardening

**Status:** ⏳ In progress — Task 1 complete, Task 2 pending metrics threshold
**Priority:** HIGH — bots confirmed hitting Firestore directly; Task 1 blocks bot writes now; Task 2 (full enforcement) pending

### Background
- reCAPTCHA console (checked June 22) confirmed only 3 real requests in 7 days, all scoring 0.9–1.0
- 31% invalid = direct API bots bypassing frontend entirely (no reCAPTCHA token)
- Real players are fine — enforcement won't hurt them
- Cache-control fix (PR #149) will clear outdated clients → verified climbs from 57% to ~69%
- Can't reach 90% organically while bots keep pulling invalid % up — enforcement IS the fix

**June 23 metrics check (46 requests, Jun 16–23 window):**
- ✅ Verified: 33% (15/46) — lower % but smaller sample
- ⚠️ Outdated: 7% (3/46) — DOWN from 12% on June 22; cache-control fix working
- ❌ Invalid: 61% (28/46) — bots; blocked at rules level by Task 1

**Decision — June 23:** Did NOT enable enforcement (Task 2). Reason: enforcement blocks ALL Firestore operations including reads. At 7% outdated, real users would lose leaderboard read access. Task 1 already blocks bot writes via `request.app.token.valid == true` in rules. Re-check ~July 6–7.

### Task 1 — Tighten Firestore Security Rules *(Firebase Console — user action)*
**✅ COMPLETE — June 23, 2026**
Rules deployed. Bot writes now blocked at rules level. `request.app.token.valid == true` enforced on create + update independent of App Check enforcement mode.

Rules deployed (for reference):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /leaderboard/{docId} {
      allow read: if true;

      allow create: if
        request.app.token.valid == true &&
        request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['score', 'instagram', 'platform', 'movement_group', 'player_id', 'date']) &&
        request.resource.data.score is int &&
        request.resource.data.score >= 1 &&
        request.resource.data.score <= 999999 &&
        request.resource.data.instagram is string &&
        request.resource.data.instagram.size() <= 50 &&
        request.resource.data.platform in ['desktop', 'mobile'] &&
        request.resource.data.movement_group in ['A', 'B'] &&
        request.resource.data.player_id is string &&
        request.resource.data.player_id.size() <= 50 &&
        request.resource.data.date == request.time;

      allow update: if
        request.app.token.valid == true &&
        request.resource.data.score is int &&
        request.resource.data.score > resource.data.score &&
        request.resource.data.score <= 999999 &&
        request.resource.data.platform in ['desktop', 'mobile'] &&
        request.resource.data.movement_group in ['A', 'B'] &&
        request.resource.data.instagram is string &&
        request.resource.data.instagram.size() <= 50 &&
        request.resource.data.date == request.time;

      allow delete: if false;
    }

    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

**Key additions over current rules:**
- `request.app.token.valid == true` on create + update — blocks any request without valid App Check token at rules level (defense in depth, independent of enforcement mode)
- `platform in ['desktop', 'mobile']` — rejects invalid platform values
- `movement_group in ['A', 'B']` — rejects invalid movement group values
- `score >= 1` — rejects zero scores
- `instagram.size() <= 50` — rejects oversized payloads
- `player_id.size() <= 50` — rejects oversized player IDs
- All 6 correct field names matching actual code (score, instagram, platform, movement_group, player_id, date)

### Task 2 — Enable App Check Enforcement *(Firebase Console — user action)*
**⏳ PENDING — waiting for verified % to reach ~90%**
Firebase Console → App Check → Cloud Firestore → click **Enforce**
Do NOT enforce until outdated % drops to ~0% and verified reaches ~90%. Enforcement blocks reads too — 7% outdated users would lose leaderboard access.
Re-check metrics: ~July 6–7.

### Task 3 — Update Leaderboard Error Message *(code change)*
**✅ COMPLETE — June 23, 2026 (PR #150)**
Updated error message in game.html:1457 + game_mobile.html:1397.
"Could not reach leaderboard. Check your connection." → "Leaderboard unavailable. Please refresh the page and try again."

## Session: June 13–15, 2026 - Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Session Duration:** ~3 sessions
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.6
**Branch:** dev
**Phase:** Security Audit

### What Was Accomplished

#### Security Audit — Phase 1 & Phase 2 (Partial) ✅

**Findings completed:**

- [x] Finding 1 — Firestore security rules (CRITICAL) — Published strict rules validating all 6 fields (date, instagram, movement_group, platform, player_id, score), score capped at 999999, catch-all deny rule added (June 13, 2026)
- [x] Finding 2 — Firebase API key restricted (HIGH) — GCP Console: HTTP referrer restrictions set to localhost, dev.nonx.standingtiger.com, nonx.standingtiger.com (June 13, 2026)
- [x] Finding 3 — XSS via innerHTML (HIGH) — Added `escapeHtml()` helper to game.html + game_mobile.html, wrapped all 4 playerName render locations. PR #123 merged (June 14, 2026)
- [x] Finding 3 (index.html) — XSS via innerHTML — Added `escapeHtml()` + wrapped playerName at lines 800 + 915. PR merged (June 14, 2026)
- [x] Finding 6 — CloudFront security headers (HIGH) — Created `nonx-security-headers` custom policy (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, CSP). Attached SecurityHeadersPolicy (managed) to prod + dev distributions (June 14, 2026)
- [x] Finding 8 — Gate dev/god URL params — `isDevEnvironment` wraps URL param block in game.html + game_mobile.html. PR pending (June 14, 2026)
- [x] Finding 16 — Firebase App Check (LOW) — Registered reCAPTCHA v3 site key, integrated App Check SDK into game.html, game_mobile.html, index.html. PR #124 merged (June 14, 2026)
- [x] Finding 18 — Gate Shift+D/Shift+A keyboard shortcuts — same `isDevEnvironment` gate in game.html + game_mobile.html. PR pending (June 14, 2026)

**⚠️ App Check enforcement pending — researched, documented** — "Outdated client requests" are NOT a CDN cache issue. They are users who haven't loaded the new App Check-enabled version of the game yet (old tab, haven't revisited). Metrics: 6:30 AM 62% → 2:17 PM 67% → 6:25 PM 61% verified (61% verified / 21% outdated / 18% invalid, 146 total). Invalid requests appeared at 6:25 PM check (were 0% before — possibly bots). Firebase guidance: enforce only when verified % reaches 85%+. Re-check June 15 ~5 AM. Do not enforce below 85% verified. Full details in DEV_ERRORS_LOG.md.

**⚠️ App Check enforcement pending — leaderboard timeout fix deployed:** Leaderboard "Loading..." hang fix confirmed implemented — 5-second timeout + .catch() on all 4 fetch calls (game.html lines 1437–1499, 1533–1535; game_mobile.html lines 1383–1442, 1476–1479). Waiting for App Check unverified % to reach 0% before enforcing. See DEV_ERRORS_LOG.md.

**Leaderboard doc:** docs/LEADERBOARD_COMPARISON.md — full code audit of both leaderboards.

**Remaining Phase 2 items:**
- [x] Finding 4 — CSP header (HIGH) — CloudFront Function `add-csp-header` deployed to both distributions in Report-Only mode (June 15, 2026). Custom Response Headers Policies require Business plan — workaround: CloudFront Function on Viewer response event (free tier, 2M invocations/month). Verified: `content-security-policy-report-only` in prod response headers.
- [x] Finding 8 — Gate dev/god URL params to non-production — `isDevEnvironment` check added to game.html + game_mobile.html. PR #129 merged (June 14, 2026)
- [x] Finding 18 — Gate Shift+D/Shift+A keyboard shortcuts to non-production — same `isDevEnvironment` gate. PR #129 merged (June 14, 2026)

**SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md** — Created June 13, 2026. 18 findings, 4 phases. Source of truth for all security work.

**Finding 5 — GA4 Consent Mode v2 — ✅ Complete (PR #130, June 14)**
- Consent default deny block added before gtag script in all 3 files
- Cookie banner (dark navy, cyan border, Accept/Decline) added after `<body>` in all 3 files
- Consent handler JS added after `escapeHtml` in all 3 files
- localStorage key: `nonx_consent` — values: `'granted'` / `'denied'`
- Note: `/privacy.html` link in banner will 404 until Privacy Policy page is created (Phase 3, Finding 5 task 3B)
- ✅ Verified June 14: banner displayed, GA4 collect requests fire after Accept, clean console in incognito

**Finding 7 — FormSubmit email hash — ✅ Complete (PR #131, June 14)**
- Replaced `stanigarkeith@gmail.com` with hash `45e055cecae307ffc412306a96dd1ff3` in game.html + game_mobile.html
- Hash activated via FormSubmit confirmation email — works on both dev and prod domains
- Email no longer visible in page source

**Finding 9 — Score from memory — ✅ Complete (audit only, June 14)**
- `var score = 0` in-memory variable used directly at Firebase submission (game.html:1423)
- `nonx_submitted_score` localStorage key only written after successful submission — used as re-submission guard, never as score source
- No code change needed

**Finding 10 — Production-safe logger — ✅ Complete (PR merged June 14)**
- `logger` object added after `isDevEnvironment` in game.html + game_mobile.html
- `isDevEnvironment` + `logger` added to index.html main script block
- 14 console.error/warn calls replaced across 3 files — silent on production, active on dev

**Finding 14 — HTML-encode savedHandle — ✅ Complete (PR merged June 14)**
- `escapeAttr()` function added after `escapeHtml` in game.html + game_mobile.html
- All 4 `savedHandle` attribute injections wrapped with `escapeAttr()`
- Verified: `value="Test's &quot;Quote&quot; &lt;tag&gt;"` in outerHTML — entities encoded correctly

**Finding 13 — Ko-fi onclick refactor — ✅ Complete (PR #134, June 14)**
- `buildKofiButtonHTML()` renamed to `buildKofiButton()`, now returns a DOM element
- `onclick`, `onmouseenter`, `onmouseleave` moved to `addEventListener` calls
- `rel="noopener noreferrer"` added to anchor
- `id="kofiButtonWrapper"` added to wrapper div; button prepended after `scorecardContent.innerHTML` set
- CI integrity check updated to match new function name
- Applied to game.html + game_mobile.html

**Phase 2 complete — all 6 findings done**
**Phase 3 complete — all 7 findings done**

**Finding 4 — CSP Report-Only violations (researched June 15, 2026):**
3 violations in DevTools Console — all caused by Firebase App Check (reCAPTCHA v3). Nothing blocked (report-only). Must fix before switching to enforcement (Phase 4 task 4F):
- **script-src** — add: `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/`
- **frame-src** — add: `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.google.com/recaptcha/`
- **connect-src** — add: `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.google.com/`
- Full updated function code documented in SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md Phase 4 task 4F

**Task 4F — CSP enforcement — ✅ Complete (June 15, 2026):**
- reCAPTCHA domains added to script-src, frame-src, connect-src
- Verified zero violations in DevTools Console (played full game on prod)
- Switched `content-security-policy-report-only` → `content-security-policy` (enforcement mode)
- Published to both distributions (prod ED9CRAIN93YRS + dev E1Q496KLUYVM0Z) at 3:42 AM UTC
- Additional fix: added `https://www.gstatic.com` to connect-src — Firebase source map files (.js.map) were blocked in enforcement mode; only triggered when DevTools is open but CSP blocks regardless. Published 4:02 AM UTC.
- Full final function code in SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md Phase 4 task 4F

**Security Audit — ALL 4 PHASES COMPLETE (June 15, 2026)**

Phase 4 final status:
- ✅ 4A — sync_paim.sh env vars + .gitignore (PR #141, June 15)
- ✅ 4B — SRI N/A (no eligible scripts, mitigated by CSP)
- ✅ 4C — HTTPS: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS — prod ED9CRAIN93YRS + dev E1Q496KLUYVM0Z verified
- ✅ 4D — TLS: prod TLSv1.3_2025 / dev TLSv1.2_2021 — both verified
- ✅ 4E — Access logging N/A (Pro plan required)
- ✅ 4F — CSP enforcement: complete, zero violations
- ✅ 4G — GA4 final_score: code + DebugView verified (⏳ dashboard ~June 16–17)

**⚠️ Two time-gated items (do not action until dates reached):**
- App Check enforcement: re-check ~June 18–19, enforce only when verified % ≥ 85%
- GA4 dashboard chart: check Explore ~June 16–17, then build Final Score × New Tier chart

**Item 6 — Favicon + OG Tags — ✅ Complete (June 15, 2026):**
- `favicon_st.png` (new asset, 1408×768) cropped to centered 768×768 square, resized to 32×32 + 180×180 via `scripts/make_favicon.py` (pure Python, no dependencies)
- Dark background preserved (no transparency bleed to white)
- Favicon link tags + Open Graph + Twitter card meta tags added to `index.html`
- Standing Tiger footer credit added below Play button on `index.html`
- Favicon link tags added to game.html + game_mobile.html (favicon persists in tab during gameplay)

**FIXED — 120fps game loop (June 15, 2026, PR #137 merged to dev):**
`performance.now()` timestamp-based 60fps cap added to `draw()` in game.html + game_mobile.html. rAF fires at display rate; frames skipped until 16.67ms elapsed. Verified: FPS reads ~60 on 120Hz monitor. `msPrev` + `MS_PER_FRAME` vars added at ~line 2110 (game.html) / 2282 (game_mobile.html).

**FIXED — Spacebar blocked in textarea fields (PR #139, June 15, 2026):**
`if (e.target.tagName === 'INPUT' || e.target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') return;` added at top of global keydown handler. game.html line 7301, game_mobile.html line 7843. Affects surveyComments, bugDescription, bugSteps. PR #139 merged to dev.

## Session: June 1, 2026 - Status: ⏳ PENDING

**Session Duration:** ~2 hours
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Branch:** dev
**Phase:** 7/7 (94% complete)

### What Was Accomplished

#### 1. Music Deployment Fix ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem:** Music files excluded from deployment causing 403 errors on dev site

**Root Cause:**
- Workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml` line 66 excluded music: `--exclude "assets/audio/music/*"`
- Added during Phase 6 as premature optimization without verifying game requirements

**Solution Applied:**
- [x] User optimized music files (removed 4 unused songs: VoidOfEchoes, Rift, VastUniverse, Ximer_EE)
- [x] Kept 2 essential files: NonexFullSong.mp3 (4.4 MB), SystemOverload.mp3 (3.2 MB)
- [x] Total reduced from 20.9 MB → 7.6 MB (64% reduction)
- [x] Removed line 66 from workflow file
- [x] Created PR #116: "fix: deploy music files to enable background audio"
- [x] Merged to dev, deployment successful (17 seconds)
- [x] Verified music plays correctly on https://dev.nonx.standingtiger.com

**Verification:** June 1, 2026, 5:50 PM
- ✅ Background music plays automatically
- ✅ Mute button functions correctly
- ✅ Sound effects still work
- ✅ No console errors

**Documentation:**
- [x] Updated DEV_ERRORS_LOG.md (marked music issue resolved)
- [x] Updated NEXT_SESSION_PRIORITIES.md (marked music deployment complete)

---

- [x] Pulled latest dev changes (23 files changed)

---

#### 3. Feature Status Updates ✅ COMPLETE

**Verified Complete:**
- [x] **Adaptive AI Difficulty** - Haiku agent (a219aa2) confirmed fully implemented on main branch
  - 7-tier difficulty system (Tiers -3 to +3)
  - Dynamic adjustments based on player deaths
  - Speed ratchet prevents exploitation
  - Score multipliers prevent low-tier dominance

**Marked Irrelevant:**
- [x] **Music Selector Feature** - Cancelled, replaced by Hero Ship Color Purchase
  - Reason: Large file size, limited player interest, most players use own music

**New Feature Documented:**
- [x] **Hero Ship Color Purchase** (docs/design/HERO_SHIP_COLOR_PURCHASE.md)
  - In-game purchase for ship colors (purple, red, green, gold, etc.)
  - Shield color automatically matches hero ship color
  - Current: blue hero + blue shield
  - Priority: After Pink Infinite Level completion

**Auto-Deploy Status:**
- [x] Dev branch auto-deploy: ✅ WORKING (dev → https://dev.nonx.standingtiger.com)
- [x] Main branch auto-deploy: ✅ READY (main → https://nonx.standingtiger.com, not yet used)

---

### What Remains (Phase 7 - Final 6%)

#### Priority 1: Dev Environment Testing (15-20 min)

**URL:** https://dev.nonx.standingtiger.com

**Firebase/Leaderboard Testing:**
- [x] Disable ad blockers (DEV_ERRORS_LOG.md documents Firebase blocked by extensions) - June 2, 2026
- [x] Verify leaderboard displays top 10 scores - June 2, 2026
- [x] Test score submission after game over - June 2, 2026
- [x] Add `dev.nonx.standingtiger.com` to Firebase authorized domains - June 2, 2026
- [x] Verify no Firebase console errors - June 2, 2026

**Note:** Firebase OAuth warning does NOT affect NON-X (game uses only Firestore, no authentication)
- Research by Haiku agent (a477ddb) confirmed no Firebase Auth usage

### Critical Warnings

**Warning 1: Test Dev Before Prod**
- Production deployment is IMMEDIATE (13 seconds, no approval)
- No manual rollback mechanism (must revert commits)
- NEVER merge dev → main without completing Priority 1 testing

**Warning 2: Production CloudFront Default Root Object**
- Missing Default Root Object = 403 error on production
- This is #1 cause of dev site 403 we fixed May 31
- CHECK THIS FIRST before any production deployment

**Warning 3: GitHub Base Branch Selection**
- GitHub UI defaults to merging into `main` (DANGEROUS!)
- Always verify base branch before creating PRs
- Use terminal for safety: `gh pr create --base dev`

**Warning 4: Music Issue Root Cause**
- Error made during Phase 6: Added music exclusion without verifying game requirements
- Lesson: Always verify dependencies before excluding files from deployment
- Prevention: Check DEV_ERRORS_LOG.md for patterns before making workflow changes

---

#### Priority 3: Post-Deployment Security (After Phase 7)

**Firebase Leaderboard Spam Prevention:**
- [ ] Research and implement device-based rate limiting for leaderboard submissions
- [ ] Limit to 1 entry per device (prevent spam/abuse)
- [ ] Options to investigate:
  - Browser fingerprinting (device ID)
  - localStorage device tracking
  - Firestore security rules with device validation
  - Server-side rate limiting via Cloud Functions
- [ ] Update Firestore security rules to enforce rate limits
- [ ] Test spam prevention without blocking legitimate users

**Note:** Current Firestore rules allow unlimited writes (anyone can spam scores)
**Priority:** High (prevents leaderboard abuse)
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 sessions

---

### Next Session Actions

**Phase 7 is COMPLETE!** 🎉

**Next Steps:**
1. **Optional:** Create favicon.ico to eliminate 403 error
2. **Priority 3:** Firebase leaderboard spam prevention (1-2 sessions)
3. **Security Audit:** Review all user input sanitization (2-3 sessions)
4. **Pink Infinite Level:** ABSOLUTE MUST - #1 feature priority (3-4 sessions)

#### 2. Critical Issue: CloudFront 403 Access Denied ✅ RESOLVED

**Timeline:**
- **6:30 PM:** User reported 403 error when accessing https://dev.nonx.standingtiger.com
- **6:33 PM:** Identified missing Default Root Object in CloudFront distribution
- **6:35 PM:** Launched Haiku research agent (a85de90) to verify fix
- **6:37 PM:** Applied fix - Set Default Root Object to `index.html`
- **6:40 PM:** CloudFront distribution saved (status: Deploying)
- **6:42 PM:** Verified S3 bucket policy (already correct from Phase 3)
- **6:45 PM:** Site tested successfully ✅

**Root Cause:**
During Phase 3 CloudFront distribution creation, the **Default Root Object** field was left empty. When users visited `dev.nonx.standingtiger.com/`, CloudFront attempted to access the S3 bucket root directly, causing 403 Access Denied instead of serving `index.html`.

**Fix Applied:**
- CloudFront distribution E1Q496KLUYVM0Z → Settings → Default root object = `index.html`
- S3 bucket policy verified (already correct with OAC configuration)

**S3 Bucket Policy (Verified Correct):**
```json
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::nonx-dev-032614958698-us-east-2-an/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::032614958698:distribution/E1Q496KLUYVM0Z"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Prevention for Future:**
- Always set Default Root Object to `index.html` during CloudFront distribution creation
- Test custom domain URL immediately after distribution creation
- Verify production CloudFront has this setting before deploying

**Accountability:**
Configuration error made during Phase 3 (May 31, 2026). Should have been caught during CloudFront setup.

### Research Findings (Haiku Agent)

**Agent a85de90: CloudFront 403 Troubleshooting**
**Task:** Research complete solution for CloudFront 403 Access Denied error with S3 OAC

**Key Findings:**
1. Missing Default Root Object is PRIMARY cause of 403 errors
2. S3 bucket policy requires CloudFront service principal with distribution ARN condition
3. OAC must be properly selected in Origins configuration
4. Block Public Access should remain enabled (secure configuration)
5. No cache invalidation needed when changing Default Root Object (config change only)

**Sources Verified:**
- AWS CloudFront documentation (HTTP 403 troubleshooting)
- AWS OAC configuration guides
- AWS S3 bucket policy examples

**Duration:** ~50 seconds
**Usage:** 23,344 tokens

---

### Critical Learnings from Session

**Git Workflow Safety:**
1. NO co-author lines in commit messages (documented in GIT_COMMIT_WORKFLOW.md)
2. ALWAYS verify base branch before creating PRs (GitHub UI defaults to main)
3. Use terminal commands for critical operations (safer than GitHub UI)
4. Test on dev before deploying to main

**AWS Configuration:**
1. Always set Default Root Object to `index.html` in CloudFront distributions
2. Verify configuration immediately after creation
3. Production should match dev security settings (Block Public Access + OAC)

**Deployment Workflow:**
1. Push to dev branch → Deploys to dev.nonx.standingtiger.com (IMMEDIATE)
2. Push to main branch → Deploys to nonx.standingtiger.com (IMMEDIATE)
3. Deployment duration: ~13 seconds
4. No rollback mechanism (must revert commits)
